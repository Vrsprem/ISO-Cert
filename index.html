  <h2>ISO 9001</h2>
  <h3>What is ISO 9001</h3>
  <p>ISO 9001:2015 sets out the criteria for a quality management system and is the only standard in the family that can be certified. It can be used by any organization, large or small, regardless of its field of activity. In fact, there are over one million companies and organizations in over 170 countries certified to ISO 9001.<br />
ISO 9001 standard is generic in nature and caters for both the manufacturing and service industries.
Organizations which are certified to this ISO 9001 standard reflect evidence of a business operation which is supported by a fundamental and robust quality management system platform.
Adopting ISO 9001:2015 demonstrates that your company is committed to quality, continued improvement and customer satisfaction.
It ensures focus and discipline in working practices which in turn delivers products and services that consistently meet customers’ requirements. It is increasingly seen as the most reliable way of demonstrating quality management when dealing with tender documents and pre-qualification questionnaires. Why they are important explained in brief below:
<ul>
<li>Improved consistency of service and product performance</li>
<li>Ensures that customers come back and not the products or services delivered</li>
<li>Improved operational efficiency and competitiveness hence reducing overheads</li>
<li>Reduce costs but increase profitability</li>
<li>Increased marketing and sales opportunities</li>
<li>Greater international acceptance and competitiveness.</li>
</ul>
<h4>How ISO 9001 will benefits to our organization </h4>
<p>Repeat business only comes to organizations which can provide services or products consistently, and without deviation. Complying with this ISO 9001 standard requirement means you can demonstrate you can do this.
In essence, organizations with an effective Quality Management System (QMS) will typically meet customer expectations better than an organization that does not have an effective QMS
